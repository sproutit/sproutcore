/**
  SC.Gesture is a simple object which can easily be extended, and which determines
  if a touch or multiple touches match any given gesture.
  
  Gestures have names. These names can be customized at any point; they are merely
  prefixes for the methods that will be called on the Gesturable view: 
  
  - [gesture]Start
  - [gesture]Changed
  - [gesture]End
  - [gesture]

  
  When an SC.Gesturable talks with SC.Gesture, it will call touchStartHasPotential first.
  
  When a touch is moving, the Gesturable will call unassignedTouchesDidChange with the set of touches.
  By default, this method calls touchIsInGesture(touch) for the touch.
  
  A gesture has two choices if it wants to take complete control of a touch. It can do so
  in a one-off way--that is, the touch will then be ignored if anything further happens with it.
  Or, it may take possession of the touch. The former will trigger [gestureName](gesture, args) on the view,
  the latter will trigger [gestureName]Start(gesture). The gesture may then trigger, at any time,
  change(arguments here) and end(arguments here).
  
  To trigger a one-off, you call trigger(touch). Otherwise, from touchIsInGesture you can return YES, or,
  if not in touchIsInGesture, call take(touch) (returning YES calls take(touch) for you). 
  
  Gestures actually become the touch responder for a touch when they take posession of it. This means that
  to release a touch, you must call touch.makeTouchResponder or touch.captureTouch(this.view) to release
  the touch. Mostly, however, gestures themselves do not need to release touches. Still, just in case, there
  is a convenience release(touch) function.
  
  Good places to call start() and end() (which call [gestureName]Start and [gestureName]End) from are
  touchStart and touchEnd, respectively.
  
  Finally, if you have ANY interest in a touch, and don't want a view to relay it to some other view just
  yet, you should call interestedInTouch(touch); if the touch is no longer interesting, call uninterestedInTouch(touch);
  
  Gestures are created by SC.Gesturable views as-needed, but last the lifetime of the view.
